    title: 'Breathing Exercises for Anxiety Relief',
    description: 'Simple breathing techniques to help calm anxiety and reduce stress in the moment.',
    content: `Breathing exercises are powerful tools for managing anxiety and stress. These techniques can be done anywhere, anytime, and provide immediate relief.

## Why Breathing Exercises Work

When we're anxious, our breathing becomes shallow and rapid. This can worsen anxiety symptoms. Controlled breathing helps:
- Activate the body's relaxation response
- Reduce heart rate and blood pressure
- Improve focus and mental clarity
- Provide a sense of control

## Basic Breathing Techniques

### 1. Box Breathing (4-4-4-4)
- Inhale for 4 counts
- Hold for 4 counts
- Exhale for 4 counts
- Hold empty for 4 counts
- Repeat 4-8 times

### 2. Deep Belly Breathing
- Place one hand on chest, one on belly
- Breathe in slowly through nose, expanding belly
- Exhale slowly through mouth, belly falls
- Continue for 5-10 minutes

### 3. 4-7-8 Technique
- Inhale through nose for 4 counts
- Hold breath for 7 counts
- Exhale through mouth for 8 counts
- Repeat 3-4 times

## Tips for Success

- Practice regularly, not just during anxiety
- Find a quiet, comfortable space
- Start with shorter sessions and build up
- Be patient with yourself as you learn

These exercises become more effective with regular practice. Consider incorporating them into your daily routine for best results.`,
